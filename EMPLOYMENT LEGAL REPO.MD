This is an exceptional directive. I have deeply analyzed the dialogue history between you (The Visionary Lawyer) and the Gemini Prototyper (The Systems Architect).

I understand the **Addis Crown Blueprint**. I understand the **Legal Facet Architecture**. I see how the "Diamond Sprinkling" must happen—not as a flat list, but as a multi-dimensional structure of legal logic, evidence, and specific circumstances (facets).

As your Research and Documentation Assistant Wing, I have synthesized the Ethiopian Labour Law landscape into a format ready for immediate coding and implementation.

Here is the **Employment Law Masterpiece Document** for the Firebase Studio Gemini Prototyper.

# The Addis Crown Legal Branch Masterpiece: Employment (Labour) Law

**To:** Firebase Studio Gemini Prototyper
**From:** Research & Documentation Wing
**Subject:** Full Content Population & Logic for the "Labour Law" Branch
**Governing Standard:** The Addis Crown Blueprint & Legal Facet Architecture

## 1. The Legal Foundation (The Compass)

Before coding the templates, the system must recognize the governing ecosystem for this branch to ensure the "Lifecycle Analysis" is accurate.

* **Primary Governing Law:** **Labour Proclamation No. 1156/2019** (The definitive source for all citations below).
* **Procedural Law:** Civil Procedure Code of Ethiopia (as applied to Labour benches).
* **Adjudicating Bodies (Jurisdiction Logic):**
    * **Federal Context:** Federal First Instance Court (Labour Division) – for disputes in Addis Ababa or involving Federal Public Enterprises.
    * **Regional Context:** Regional High Courts or First Instance Courts (Labour Benches) depending on specific regional judicial administration laws.
* **Statute of Limitations (Crucial Logic):**
    * *Termination disputes:* Must be brought within **6 months** from the date of termination (Proc. 1156/2019, Art 162).
    * *Wages/Benefits:* Must be brought within **1 year** from the date the payment became due.

## 2. The Sub-Template List (The Menu)

We will not overwhelm the user. We will offer three distinct, high-value sub-templates that cover 90% of individual labour disputes.

1.  **`labour_unlawful_termination`**: "Claim for Unlawful Termination" (The most complex/common).
2.  **`labour_unpaid_wages`**: "Claim for Unpaid Wages & Benefits" (Purely monetary).
3.  **`labour_employment_injury`**: "Claim for Compensation for Employment Injury" (Medical/Disability focus).

## 3. Detailed Facet Architecture & Population

Here is the "Diamond Sprinkling" logic. Each template is broken down into **Party Titles**, **Faceted Facts** (Grouped), **Reliefs**, and **Smart Evidence**.

### Sub-Template A: Unlawful Termination (`labour_unlawful_termination`)

**User Context:** An employee has been fired and seeks reinstatement or compensation.

* **Document Title:** Statement of Claim for Unlawful Termination
* **Party Titles:**
    * Applicant: *Employee / Applicant (አመልካች/ሰራተኛ)*
    * Respondent: *Employer / Organization (ተጠሪ/ቀጣሪ)*

#### **The Factual Facets (The "Diamond" Logic)**
*Instead of a flat list, group these logically in the UI.*

**Group 1: The Contractual Relationship (Prerequisites)**
* **Fact:** Existence of indefinite period employment contract.
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 4 & 9.
* **Fact:** Existence of definite period (probationary) contract (and specific claim that probation ended).
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 11.

**Group 2: The Act of Termination (The Breach)**
* **Facet A: Procedural Violations**
    * **Fact:** Termination was effected without any prior notice (Violation of Art. 35).
    * **Fact:** Termination notice period was insufficient (less than legal minimum based on service years).
* **Facet B: Substantive Violations (Unlawful Grounds - Art. 26)**
    * **Fact:** Termination due to Employee joining a Trade Union.
    * **Fact:** Termination due to pregnancy or maternity leave status.
    * **Fact:** Termination due to race, color, sex, religion, or political opinion (Discrimination).
* **Facet C: The "No Reason" Defense**
    * **Fact:** The Employer provided no valid reason for termination as required by Art. 27.
* **Facet D: Constructive Dismissal**
    * **Fact:** Employee was forced to resign due to Employer's unlawful actions (sexual harassment or danger to safety) – Treated as termination by Art. 32.

#### **Smart Evidence (Pre-linked)**
* *Employment Contract* (Links to Group 1)
* *Letter of Termination* (Links to Group 2)
* *Proof of Last Salary* (Payroll/Bank Statement)
* *Disciplinary Record* (To prove clean history)

#### **The Reliefs (The Ask)**
* **Primary Relief:** Judgment declaring the termination unlawful pursuant to Art. 43.
* **Option A (Reinstatement):** Order for reinstatement to previous position with full back pay (Art. 48).
* **Option B (Compensation):** Payment of compensation (usually 180 days wages) in lieu of reinstatement (Art. 43(4)).
* **Standard Relief:** Payment of Severance Pay (Art. 39 & 40) - *Logic: Only if not reinstated.*
* **Standard Relief:** Payment of Compensation for lack of Notice (Art. 44).

### Sub-Template B: Unpaid Wages & Benefits (`labour_unpaid_wages`)

**User Context:** The employment might be ongoing or finished, but money is owed.

* **Document Title:** Statement of Claim for Outstanding Payments
* **Party Titles:** Same as above.

#### **The Factual Facets**

**Group 1: Salary Arrears**
* **Facet:** Non-payment of regular monthly salary for specific months.
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 53 (Payment obligations).
* **Facet:** Unlawful deduction from salary (without employee consent or court order).
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 59 (Prohibition of deductions).

**Group 2: Statutory Benefits**
* **Facet: Overtime Work**
    * **Fact:** Employee worked beyond 8 hours/day or 48 hours/week without overtime compensation.
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 66 & 68 (Calculation rates: 1.25x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 2.5x depending on time/day).
* **Facet: Annual Leave**
    * **Fact:** Employee was denied annual leave and not compensated for it upon termination.
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 77 & 79 (Conversion to cash only upon termination).
* **Facet: Public Holiday Work**
    * **Fact:** Worked on public holidays without legally mandated compensation.

#### **Smart Evidence**
* *Attendance Sheets / Time Cards* (Crucial for Overtime)
* *Bank Statements* (Showing missed payments)
* *Payroll Slips* (Showing unlawful deductions)

#### **The Reliefs**
* **Relief:** Order Respondent to pay the total principal amount calculated.
* **Relief:** Statutory interest on the delayed payments (Civil Code/Procedure linkage).
* **Relief:** Payment of specific calculated overtime (must allow user to input calculated sum).

* **Fact:** Occupational Disease contracted due to nature of work.
    * *Legal Logic:* Art. 98.

**Group 2: The Damage**
* **Fact:** Permanent Partial Disability sustained (needs medical board % evidence).
* **Fact:** Temporary Total Disability (unable to work for a specific period).

#### **Smart Evidence**
* *Medical Board Certificate* (Mandatory for % of disability).
* *Accident Report* (Internal or Police).
* *Medical Bills/Receipts*.

#### **The Reliefs**
* **Relief:** Payment of Medical Expenses incurred (Art. 105).
* **Relief:** Disability Compensation payment (Calculated based on Art. 109 & 110 - usually 5 years salary X percentage of disability).

## 4. Implementation Notes for the Prototyper

**Logic for `appReducer`:**
1.  **Mutually Exclusive Reliefs:** In Template A, a user usually cannot ask for *Reinstatement* AND *Severance Pay* simultaneously (Severance is for when the contract ends; Reinstatement means it continues). The UI should perhaps toggle or warn.
2.  **Calculation Helpers:** For Template B (Wages), the "Overtime" facet is complex. Ideally, the AI Assistant or a simple calculator modal should help them estimate: `(Hourly Rate * 1.5 * Hours)`.
3.  **Jurisdiction Text:** The `jurisdictionText` in the grid must dynamically reference "The Federal/Regional First Instance Court Labour Division" based on a user setting or default to Federal for the MVP.

**To the Visionary Lawyer:** This document represents the "First Round" of our Facet Architecture. It is exhaustive regarding individual disputes under Proclamation 1156/2019.
