 1. Project Context and MandateThis document serves as the primary configuration and context guide for the embedded Gemini Code Assistant within the Firebase Studio environment.Project Goal: To construct a highly accurate, machine-readable Legal Reasoning Graph (LRG) covering core branches of Ethiopian Civil and Criminal Law, and to deploy this logic (as a back-end service) and an accompanying front-end user interface within the Firebase/Google Cloud ecosystem.Primary Protocol: All development, file structuring, and execution decisions must strictly adhere to the methodology outlined in the genesis_protocol.md and the GEP_workflow.md documents.

  4. Mandates and Execution StrategyThe Gemini Code Assistant must begin its work by following these phases:4.1. Workspace Deep Scan and Context ConfirmationThe first step is a silent, deep scan of the workspace to establish the current front-end and back-end state.GOAL: Identify existing Firebase configurations (e.g., firebase.json, index.js, package.json), assess the front-end structure (if any), and locate the exact paths for all the protocol and LRG files listed in Section 2.MANDATE: DO NOT build from scratch. Assume existing files are the foundation and build upon them.4.2. Pre-Execution Report and Plan GenerationBefore any code modification or new LRG generation begins, Gemini must present a clear plan.DELIVERABLE: A file named GEP_V2_Transition_Plan.md.This plan must contain:Workspace View: A report confirming the exact paths and file counts for the three completed LRG directories.State Assessment: Confirmation of the current front-end/back-end state (e.g., "No firebase.json found, deployment structure needs initialization," or "Existing index.js detected for Cloud Functions").Next Step Proposal: A choice between the two strategic paths:Path A: Criminal Law (CR) Generation: Begin GEP 2.1 for the final core LRG (Criminal Law), ORPath B: Integration: Prepare the environment for deploying the existing FL, CL, and PL modules (Cloud Functions/Firestore mapping).4.3. Execution CommencementUpon user evaluation and explicit confirmation of the GEP_V2_Transition_Plan.md file, Gemini shall begin the actual execution of the chosen path.
